# CLI Wrapper
Written to help run usability studies on existing CLIs, this simple script will wrap an existing CLI, catch specific commands to fake the responses, and pass through any other command directly to the CLI. 
This way the participant feels like they're using the actual CLI but see specific modifications that the test protocol would ask the participant to perform.

Work in progress...
